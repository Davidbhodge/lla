(in-package :lla)

;; do vector operations
;; elementwise, element & scalar
;; dot product
;; matrix operations just ride on this, w/ checking conformability
;; names like m+, m-, m*, m/, dot-product
;; NO R-like vector recycling, do that with xref
;; if no type: fall back on xref
;; equality
;; sum
;; product
;; or do a general reduce
;; some of this sould really belong to xref, not lla
