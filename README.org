* Lisp Linear Algebra --- a linear algebra library for Common Lisp

The library is currently undergoind a reorganizaton.  Documentation
will appear here when the reorganization is finished and I have time.

** Intel MKL 
=/etc/ld.so.conf.d/=
#+BEGIN_SRC 
/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64
/opt/intel/composerxe/lib/intel64
#+END_SRC

** Things to do (roughly in order of priority)
   [ ] decide whether hermitian matrices use upper or lower triangle
   (look at functions that use hermitian matrices, in principle this
   should not matter much) NOTE: currently it is lower, but not
   hardcoded, I wrote some query functions

   [ ] clean up linear algebra operations, finish missing methods; in
   particular: svd, eigen, trace, rank

   [ ] write SBCL and ECL pinning interfaces

   [ ] write notes on how to compile LAPACK(E) for those who don't
   want to use the Intel MKL

   [ ] write hermitian factorization methods, inverse
   
   [ ] write documentation

   [ ] write more tests
   
   [ ] maybe move == from tests to CLNU, it is quite handy, could be
   rewritten with explicit optional argument

** Wishlist
   [ ] foreign-atoms is no longer needed now that we are using a C
   interface: move it into array/vector copying code (see point below)
   
   [ ] make array copying code faster, specializing on array element
   types, profile and benchmark
   
   [ ] maybe LLA types are not needed at all?  CL types could work
   just as well, then all functions could use CL types (not a high
   priority at the moment)
